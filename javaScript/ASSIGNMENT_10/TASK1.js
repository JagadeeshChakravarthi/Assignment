1.Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.

No, higher-order functions and callback functions are not the same. 
A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument, and is then invoked by the outer function to complete some sort of action.
